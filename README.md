# CursesGame
This is a game I am building using ncurses, such that it can be run in an extremely graphically simple environment, such as a command line.

## Goals and features
Not sure gameplay wise, but i want to include some method of random encounters with npcs

Ideally I want to stay away from turn based combat. I can just loop in timers inside the os to do so.

## MILESTONES
- Render with curses
- Custom window rendering
- serializing the game world as some kind of file

STRETCH
- robust engine support for multiwindow layouts etc
